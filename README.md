# My dotfiles üë®‚Äçüíª

These are the dotfiles that configure the tools I use in my system, and some installation scripts that automatically install all the following packages. I constantly try to improve my development workflow. 

### Setup

First, clone the `dotifiles` repo in your `$HOME` directory:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com/aalykiot/dotfiles
```

then, use the `install.sh` script to install the packages:

```sh
$ cd dotfiles/ && ./install.sh
```

finally, symlink the config files to the right places:

```sh
$ stow .
```
